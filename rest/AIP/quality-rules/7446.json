    "description": "Double checked locking is a software design pattern used to reduce locking overhead when implementing lazy initialization in a multi-thread environment. This avoids initializing a value until the first time it is accessed.\nThis pattern is unsafe because there is no guarantee it will work on single or multi-processor machines.\n\nFor JSE 4.x and previous versions, all methods that are not synchronized and that use double checked locking will be reported.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "Double-checked locking refers to the situation where a programmer checks to see if a resource has been initialized, grabs a lock, checks again to see if the resource has been initialized, and then performs the initialization if it has not occurred yet. This should not be done, as is not guaranteed to work in all languages and on all architectures. In summary, other threads may not be operating inside the synchronous block and are not guaranteed to see the operations execute in the same order as they would appear inside the synchronous block.",

    "remediation": "To remediate, there are three solutions depending on performance considerations:\n1/ synchronize the method: each call to this method will cost more but the initialization will be made when needed\n2/ use Initialize-On-Demand Holder Class idiom: the field will be initialized during the initialization of the class even if is not required, but each call to the method that returns this field will not.\n3/ make the field volatile - Java 5 and above",
