    "remediation": "PostgreSQL: Generating random numbers can be performed using the random() function. For generating random strings, you can use the value returned from the random() function coupled with an md5() function.\n\n\nThe MySQL RAND function is not fully equivalent to Oracle DBMS_RANDOM because it does not generate string values. However, there are other functions that can be used in combination to achieve full functionality.\nRAND function returns a random floating-point value v in the range 0 \u2192 v < 1.0. You can use the RAND function with a seed value to reset the seed. If an integer argument N is specified, it is used as the seed value:",
