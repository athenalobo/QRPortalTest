Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application, which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web browser.\nOnce the malicious script is injected, the attacker can perform a variety of malicious activities, such as: get private information, send malicious requests to a web site on behalf of the victim.\n\nThe most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to the victim.",
