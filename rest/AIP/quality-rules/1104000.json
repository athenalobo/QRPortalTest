    "description": "Associations are a different type of gathering data together from multiple tables. We call them Join-on-demand. This means that the data in the joined (associated) tables is not accessible directly at run time, but only on demand. It is triggered only when the user needs that data. This is quite neat. Performance-wise, this can be a game changer.",
    "output": "Associated to each violation, the following information is provided:\n- The number of violation occurrences\n- Bookmarks for violation occurrences found in the source code",
    "rationale": "Usually  the result of joining the two tables will be a set of data consisting of Order Headers and their Items. The select will gather all the requested data from both tables. That means, even if a business user is interested only in header information the view still fetch data from both tables. This will impact application performance mainly when perform join on large set of tables",
